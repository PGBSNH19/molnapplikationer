# Remote

The fact that the course "Utveckling av moln baserade applikationer" from day 1 is a remote course, will have some positive and negative consequences.

The negative consequences includes:

- We will need to work within the limits of our tools, luckily the limits are not that many
- The needed discipline for both teacher and students are much higher in a remote setup

The positive consequences include:

* We will train working remote which is often used in the industry
* We can utilize a lot of digital tools
* We now have the possibility to record selected parts of the teaching

## When to join

I **strongly** recommend that you attend the lecture on the platform (Teams) during the lecture even if the teaching should be recorded will you miss out on the possibility to interact during lecture.

If you are sick, stay in bed and be sick! Don't force yourself in front of the computer! But inform the instructor/teacher as soon as possible.

# Schedule

The schedule for the course is the same in the remote version as in the physical: 8:30 to 16:30.

# Your remote set up

Make sure you have a **headset** of a medium quality (higher quality is better)! You should not use the build-in speaker and mic in your laptop!

Make sure you have a webcam, and that it's filming your face. And that the light in the room makes it possible to see you. We will use video when possible and encourage everybody to use video (maybe will we need to switch it of during lectures due to performance... we will see).

When you are not talking set your mic to mute!

**Important** : Test your sound and mic before each lecture. Make sure you don't have any feedback loop or echo where sound from your speakers can reach your mic.

# Lecture elements

We will try to have a digital, and maybe low tech version of many of the elements from the physical class room.
